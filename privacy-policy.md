# Privacy Policy

Data stored by this extension is only accessible to the respective user of the extension and Google Chrome â€” not the [author(s) of this extension](https://github.com/NimJay/new-tab-page-chrome-extension/graphs/contributors). All data related to this Chrome extension is stored inside Chrome extensions' [`chrome.storage.sync` API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/#property-sync) (which means Chrome syncs the user's data to any Chrome browser that the user is logged into).

The following is the full list of data stored by this Chrome extension:

1. **Configuration of "new tab" page** - This extension replaces the default Chrome extension. The user gets to customize the set of links and quotes displayed on this extension's "new tab" page. This configuration is stored in the [`chrome.storage.sync` API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/#property-sync).

2. **"New tab" page link usage** - This extension may alter the UI of its "new tab" page (such as the opacity of certain links) based on how (often and recently) links are used. Data about link usage will be stored in the [`chrome.storage.sync` API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/#property-sync).
